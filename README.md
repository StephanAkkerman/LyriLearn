## Introduction

If you listen to music from different countries, you might find it challenging to understand the lyrics in foreign languages. LyriLearn is a Python application that helps you learn foreign languages through song lyrics. It fetches synchronized lyrics for a given song, translates them into your target language, and displays them in sync with the music playback. This way, you can enjoy your favorite songs while improving your language skills!
