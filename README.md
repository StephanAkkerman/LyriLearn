## Introduction

If you listen to music from different countries, you might find it challenging to understand the lyrics in foreign languages. LyriLearn is a Python application that helps you learn foreign languages through song lyrics. It fetches synchronized lyrics for a given song, translates them into your target language, and displays them in sync with the music playback. This way, you can enjoy your favorite songs while improving your language skills!

Using it is simple: provide the song title and artist, and LyriLearn will take care of the rest. It uses powerful libraries like FastAPI for the backend, Google Translate for translation, and Stanza for part-of-speech tagging to enhance your learning experience.

You can use it by running the backend with Python and heading to [http://akkerman.ai/LyriLearn/](http://akkerman.ai/LyriLearn/) or by opening the index.html file in your browser.

The image below shows a screenshot of the application in action:
